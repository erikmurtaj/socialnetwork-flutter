# socialnetwork_flutter

This is a project for the bachelor Thesis at the [Bacheleror Degree in Computer Science](http://www.cs.unicam.it)
at [University of Camerino](http://www.unicam.it/).

This project is developed in Dart with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and using the
[FireBase](https://flutter.dev/) platform

## Description
Creation of an App using specific Google services for the development of Mobile Applications.

Aims:
1. Evaluation and use of the Flutter Framework
2. Evaluation and use of the Dart programming language (required for Flutter)
3. Evaluation and use of the Firebase platform (such as Cloud and DataBase for data persistence)
4. Development of a working mobile application that uses the proposed technologies

In order to evaluate the use of these technologies, the idea is to develop a Social Network where users can interact with videos shared by other users.
Since the architecture of the application are very complex, I plan to create a stable application with basic functionality, which can be extended outside the Thesis for future developments.

The focus of this thesis is to evaluate the effectiveness and advantages in using the google technologies for the creation of a mobile application.

## Getting Started

To run this project you need to install Android Studio and an updated version of [Gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/blob/master/README.md).

Then you can run the project through Android Studio with a virtual device, or build the project manually using a terminal as follow:

```python
gradle build
```

After the build run the project with the following command:
```python
flutter run
```


For help with Flutter, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
